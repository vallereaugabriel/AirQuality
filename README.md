## Usage
All the following actions must be done in the root directory where the file *package.json* is.  
You must run `yarn` or `npm i` first to get all the dependencies.  
Then run `yarn build` or `npm run build` to bundle the application.  
You can now open *index.html* in your favorite browser to use the application.

## Tests
To run the tests simply run the command `yarn test` or `npm run test` in the root directory.
